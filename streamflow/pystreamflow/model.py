class RiverModel(pints.ForwardModel):
    """Rainfall runoff model of river streamflow.

    The model divides the movement of water through the river basin into the
    following spatially-grouped components representing different hydrological
    processes:

        * Interception, representing vegetation. Rainfall lands on vegetative
          surfaces such as leaves and stems, at which point it may either enter
          the ground or evaporate back into the air.
        * Unsaturated zone, representing the soil above the water table.

    From the unsaturated zone, water can enter the river flow via one of two
    processes:

        * A slow reservoir, representing percolation
        * A fast reservoir, representing surface runoff

    The model has four latent state variables, each giving the level of water
    in the components described above, which varies over time:

        * S_i = interception storage
        * S_u = unsaturated storage
        * S_s = slow reservoir
        * S_f = fast reservoir

    and one observed variable (in fact, it is dz/dt, or the streamflow, that is
    observed):

        * z = water flowed out of the river

    The behavior of all the variables is governed by a system of differential
    equations, namely

        * dS_i/dt = Precip(t) - InterceptEvap(t) - EffectPrecip(t)
        * dS_u/dt = EffectPrecip(t) - UnsatEvap(t) - Percolation(t) - Runoff(t)
        * dS_s/dt = Percolation(t) - SlowStream(t)
        * dS_f/dt = Runoff(t) - FastStream(t)
        * dz/dt = SlowStream(t) + FastStream(t)

    Each term is defined below. The model is characterized by the following
    unknown parameters:

        * I_max = maximum interception
        * S_u,max = unsaturated storage capacity
        * Q_s,max = maximum percolation
        * alpha_e = evaporation flux shape
        * alpha_f = runoff flux shape
        * K_s = slow reservoir time constant
        * K_f = fast reservoir time constant

    as well as the following two parameters whose values are here assumed fixed
    and known:

        * alpha_s = 0 (percolation flux shape)
        * alpha_i = 50 (interception flux shape)

    Appearing multiple times in the model is the flux function f, given by:

        * f(S, a) = (1 - exp(-a * S)) / (1 - exp(-a))

    Precip = measured precipitation (provided as input to the model)

    Evap = measured or theoretical evaporation (provided as input to the model)

    InterceptEvap = evaporation from the interception component

        * InterceptEvap(t) = Evap(t) * f(S_i / I_max, alpha_i)

    EffectPrecip = effective precipitation that gets sent to unsaturated
    storage

        * EffectPrecip(t) = Precip(t) * f(S_i / I_max, -alpha_i)

    UnsatEvap = evaporation from unsaturated storage

        * UnsatEvap(t) = max(0, Evap(t) - InterceptEvap(t))
                       * f(S_u / S_u,max, alpha_e)

    Percolation = trickling of water through the ground

        * Percolation(t) = Q_s,max * f(S_u / S_u,max, alpha_s)

    Runoff = flow of water on the surface

        * Runoff(t) = EffectPrecip(t) * f(S_u / S_u,max, alpha_f)

    SlowStream = The slow component of the river flow

        * SlowStream(t) = S_s / K_s

    FastStream = The fast component of the river flow

        * FastStream(t) = S_f / K_f

    This is the model that was studied in [1]_. See also [2]_, which contains
    further details for models of this type.
